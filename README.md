# Snake Game with Gesture Control and Grid Visuals
## Overview
#### This project is a modern take on the classic Snake game, developed in Python using Pygame. It features dual control modes: traditional keyboard input and innovative gesture control via webcam using OpenCV. A grid overlay enhances the visual experience.
---
## Features
- Keyboard and webcam gesture controls
- Grid overlay for clear visuals
- Food spawning and snake growth mechanics
- Collision detection with walls and self
- Performance optimizations including frame resizing and debounce logic
---
## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.13.7 or later is installed.
2.	Install dependencies:
   pip install pygame==2.6.1 opencv-python==4.10.0
4.	Run the game:

## Usage
- Use arrow keys to control the snake.
- Alternatively, use a green object in front of your webcam to control the snake via gestures.
